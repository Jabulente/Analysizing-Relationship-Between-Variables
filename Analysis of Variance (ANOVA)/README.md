  <h1 align='center'>Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)</h1>


  <p>In many data analysis tasks, especially when comparing the effect of one or more categorical factors on a continuous outcome, it's important to determine whether differences in group means are statistically significant. Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) is a statistical method used to compare the means of three or more groups. It does this by analyzing the variation within groups and between groups to assess whether the observed differences in sample means are likely due to a real effect or could have occurred by random chance. ANOVA is widely used because it allows for the evaluation of multiple groups simultaneously while controlling the overall error rate.

  <p>This project showcases the application of <span class="highlight">statistical analysis</span> techniques to compare group means using both <strong>One-Way</strong> and <strong>Two-Way ANOVA</strong>. The emphasis lies in <em>validating key assumptions</em> such as normality and homogeneity of variance prior to analysis, ensuring rigorous and reliable conclusions.</p>

  <h2>üéØ Purpose</h2>
  <p>The primary objective of this analysis is to investigate whether statistically significant differences exist in the means of a continuous variable across multiple groups defined by one or two categorical factors. By incorporating assumption testing and subsequent ANOVA, the project delivers robust insights into the relationships between variables.</p>
