 <h1 align='center'> Analyzing Relationship Between Variables</h1>
 
This repository showcases a comprehensive correlation analysis project, demonstrating the application of statistical techniques to identify, measure, and visualize relationships between variables. It includes clean and well-documented Python scripts for computing correlation coefficients (Pearson, Spearman, Kendall), generating correlation heatmaps, and interpreting results with real-world datasets. The project highlights best practices in exploratory data analysis (EDA), helping uncover patterns, multicollinearity issues, and insights useful for predictive modeling and decision-making.
